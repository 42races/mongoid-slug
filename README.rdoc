= Mongoid Slug

When included in a Mongoid-based model, this library generates a URL slug/permalink based on a field.

    class Book
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::Slug
      field :title
      slug  :title
    end
    
    >> book.create(:title => "A Thousand Plateaus").to_param
    "a-thousand-plateaus"
