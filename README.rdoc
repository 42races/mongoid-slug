= Mongoid Slug

When included in a Mongoid-based model, this library generates a URL slug/permalink based on a field.

    class Book
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::Slug
      field :title
      slug  :title
    end
    
    >> book = Book.create(:title => "A Thousand Plateaus")
    >> book.to_param
    "a-thousand-plateaus"
    >> book.update_attributes(:title => "Anti Oedipus")
    >> book.to_param
    "anti-oedipus"
